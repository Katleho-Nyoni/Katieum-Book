    "text": "1.1 HISTORY\nThe idea of grouping things has existed for the longest of time in the history of the Modern Homo Sapiens specie. The study of grouping objects was later called set theory, where a set is a collection/grouping of objects. The study of modern set theory is often attributed to one of its founders, a prominent German mathematician—George Cantor along with another German mathematician Richard Dedekind, which they developed in the 1870s.\nAs the topic was relatively new and hot at the time, it received backlashes often from older mathematicians who did not embrace new idea. A famous mathematician and philosopher, Bertrand Russell also attacked some of these ideas which gave birth to a concepts like Russell’s Paradoxes or fuzzy set theory. However, as I’ve outline that this isn’t a new idea, you have also used sets in your daily life. Formally, a\nThese objects are also called members. A classroom is a set made of students, and these students are the members of this set. In that same classroom, we can have a set which consists of only boys. Remember that the art of grouping can group things that have similarities or are entirely different. The classroom set has both girls and boys. The similarity is that they’re all human. The set grouping all boys in that classroom share the similarity being that they’re boys, but they’re most likely different in many other ways, from names to their Blood Pressure. A set is often denoted with a capital letter & curly braces , while the elements are denoted by small letters .Let \\[\nV = \\{𝑎,𝑒,𝑖,𝑜,𝑢\\}\n\\] Be an example where the set \\(V\\) is the set of all vowels. Where \\(𝑎,𝑒,𝑖,𝑜,𝑢\\) are the members of the set \\(V\\). The curly braces means “the set of”. Since \\(u\\) and \\(a, 𝑒,𝑖, 𝑜,𝑢\\) are elements of \\(V\\), we denote it as \\(u𝜖V\\) and \\[(𝑎,𝑒,𝑖,𝑜,𝑢)𝜖V ≡ 𝑎,𝑒,𝑖,𝑜,𝑢𝜖V\\]\nRespectively. It oath to be noted that the order of elements in the set and repetition are not important, thus a set with elements \\[\\{𝑜, 𝑒, 𝑢,𝑎,𝑖\\}\\] and \\[\\{𝑎,𝑎,𝑖,𝑖,𝑖,𝑖,𝑖,𝑜,𝑢,𝑒,𝑒\\} \\] Are the same as the set \\(V\\). The number of elements within a set are referred to as a Cardinality, denoted by the absolute bars \\(|𝑋|\\) where \\(X\\) is a set. Thus the cardinality of the set of vowels \\(𝑉\\) is \\(5\\) denoted \\[|V| = 5\\].\nAnother simple example would be as follows, lets call it the Black Box example :\nSuppose you have a Black Box in a class, then ask each and every student to put a paper inside of the box(more like voting). The papers could be different colors and shapes, or just all plain White square papers.\nThe Box will act as a set while the papers of the students inside the box are regarded as the elements of the set(or elements of the box). If the box was empty, then we’d say the box is an empty set/null set. This is a special case of a set and it is denoted by\n\\(\\phi\\) or empty curly braces \\(\\{\\}\\). In turn, \\(\\phi = \\{\\}\\) with a cardinality of \\(0\\).",

For the first question : a. 𝐴 and 𝐵 are not equal since 𝐴 is a null set-without elements while 𝐵 is a set that has a null set as an element. Thus, 𝐴 ≠ 𝐵 b. 𝐴 and 𝐶 are equal since 𝐴 is a null set-without elements and � � is also set that has no elements in it.

As per the name suggests, it a portion of a set and it is denoted by ⊆. Formally, we say the set 1 is the subset of � � 2 if every element of � � 1 is also an element in � � 2 . Suppose you have three sets 𝐴 = {2,4,6,8,10} ; 𝐵 = {2,6,8} and 𝐶 = {2,6}. � � is the subset of 𝐴 and 𝐵 since 2 & 6 are in both the sets 𝐴 and 𝐵,that is � � ⊆𝐴 and 𝐶 ⊆𝐵.\nSet 𝐵 is a subset of 𝐴 but not of 𝐶. That is\n� � ⊆𝐴 and 𝐵 ⊈𝐶.\nAnd lastly 𝐴 is not a subset of either sets. Every set is a subset of itself. Common basic sets which are also subsets of others include :\no Integers: all set of numbers without a decimal. These are all set of integers which are either positive or negative. Represented by the symbol ℤ denoted by ℤ = {…,−3,−2,−1,0,1,2,3,…}. o Natural Numbers: all positive integers EXCEPT 0. Represented by the symbol ℕ denoted by ℕ = {1,2,3,…}. o Whole Numbers: all positive integers INCLUDING 0, denoted by ℕ0 = {0,1,2,3, …}. o Rational Numbers: Represented by the symbol ℚ. All fractions of the form\nℚ={𝑎 𝑏 | 𝑎,𝑏 ∈ ℤ ,𝑏≠ 0 }. o Irrational numbers: numbers that are thought not to be rational are said to be irrational. o Imaginary Numbers: imagined numbers that may not exist where √−1 =𝑖 o Real Numbers: all numbers that can be quantified and thought not to be imaginary. These numbers are made up by both rational and irrational numbers Represented by the symbol ℝ o Complex Numbers: a combination of both real and imaginary numbers.

    "text": "4.1 HISTORY\nThe idea of sequences and series’ go a long way back into the past. One of the earliest encounters could be seen around 5th BCE where the famous Greek philosopher Zeno of Elea introduced a number of problems where only Nine survived, which came to be known as Zeno’s Paradoxes, these were his proposals to the questions concerning space and time at their time.\nOn one of them, Zeno argued that a man who wanted to walk across a room, had to walk half the distance of the room first, but before travelling that distance they had to travel halfway of that half, then half of that, and repeatedly infinitely many times producing the sequence \\[\n...,\\frac{1}{16},\\frac{1}{8},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{2},1\n\\]\nWhich he claimed was impossible since it requires a number of infinite tasks and wouldn’t have the first distance to travel, meaning the journey wouldn’t even start. Traveling across the same room would give the sequence \\[\n1,\\frac{1}{2},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{8},\\frac{1}{16},...,\\frac{1}{2^n}\n\\]\nThis sequence is popularly known as the Geometric sequence. More about that later. In present day, sequence and series has become increasingly important as it is widely used in almost every field. In finance it is used to calculate the return of loans and investments, in physics it is used to study waves and their properties. In Chemistry it is used to see how chemical reactions end, in Statistics it is used to study trends, in ecology and epidemiology it is used to model populations of the same and different species. In astronomy and cosmology it is used to study the emission of radiation/energy of celestial bodies; and it is used by TikTok and Netflix to recommend you videos and movies you may like.\nFirst and foremost, what’s the difference between a sequence and a series?\nSequence : a list of ordered numbers separated by a comma e.g. \\[1,2,3,4,…,𝑛\\] where \\(1\\) is the 1st term denoted by \\(T_1\\) \\[2,4,6,8,…,2n\\] where \\(2n\\) is the formula for the sequence denoted \\(𝑇_𝑛\\) \\[3,6,9,12,…,2𝑛+1\\]\nThus, a sequence is denoted by \\[\n1, 𝑇_2, 𝑇_3,…,𝑇_𝑛\n\\] Series : the sum of individual terms that form a sequence, separated by an operator \\(\\pm\\) e.g. \\[1 + 2 +3+4+⋯ \\] \\[2 +4+6+8+⋯ \\] \\[3 +6+9+12+⋯ \\] T hus, a series is denoted by \\[\nS_n = 𝑇_1 +𝑇_2+𝑇_3+⋯+𝑇_𝑛 = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}T_i\n\\] Where \\[\nS_1 = 𝑇_1\n\\] \\[\n𝑆_2 = 𝑇_1 +T_2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{2} T_𝑖\n\\] \\[\n𝑆_3 = 𝑇_1 +T_2 +T_3 = \\sum_{i=1}^{3} T_𝑖\n\\] There are recursive and non-recursive sequences.\nRECURSIVE : these are sequences which whose terms are dependent on the previous term. They are a ‘regress’. A very famous one is the Fibonacci sequence that appears a lot in nature, especially in the rows of corn or becomes the sequence of the petals on a flower. Fibonacci sequence : \\[0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,… \\] Another interesting example is the logistic equation, which is often a realistic approach used to model the population of species.\nNON-RECURSIVE : sequences that are not recursive. These are the ‘normal’ ones. We’ll only be dealing with the Arithmetic(linear), Quadratic and Geometric sequences and series’.",

    "text": "4.2 ARITHMETIC SEQUENCE\nAn Arithmetic sequence can be seen as a linear function where the \\(c\\) in \\[y = mx+c \\] can either be negative or positive. This is a constant(fixed) number that is added to each previous term to find the next. For the sake of formality, in this chapter we use the notation \\[\nT_n = 𝜙𝑛+𝛾                         \n\\]\nBut more importantly, to obtain the equation in 2.2 , we use the equation \\[\nT_n= 𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑                               \n\\] Where \\(𝜙 = d\\) and $𝛾 = 𝑎−𝑑 $. Here \\(𝑇_𝑛\\) denotes the general term, 𝑎 the first term of the sequence and 𝑑 is the common difference. Since a sequence is defined by \\[\nT_1,T_2,T_3,...,T_n\n\\]\n***********************************************UPDATED TILL HERE********************************************\nTo obtain the next term in the arithmetic sequence you have to add the common difference 𝑑, thus Then to get the common difference 𝑑 we get it by subtracting from the previous term EXAMPLE 1\nSuppose you’re given the arithmetic sequence 5,9,13,17,… and you’re asked to find: a) the common difference 𝑑\nb) the next three terms c) the general term 𝑇𝑛\nd) using the general term, find the 100th term 5 | Page ScienceVisu\ne) which term in the sequence is equal to 1181 SOLUTION a) To find 𝑑, we calculate the difference of two numbers that are next to each other, preferably from right to left. Thus selecting any two would give 𝑑 = 9−5 = 4 . Which means that the terms of our sequences are increasing by 4 each time, that is added to the previous term, since the term is positive. b) Using 𝑑 as 4 as found in the previous question we get � �5 = 17+4=21 � �6 = 21+4=25\n� �7 = 25+4=29 c) Using equation 1.1.2 we obtain\n� �𝑛 = 5+(𝑛−1)(4) � �𝑛 = 5+4𝑛−4 � �𝑛 = 4𝑛+1 Or alternatively, we could approach it as\n� �𝑛 = (4)𝑛+(5)−(4) Which yields the same results. d) Since we now have the general term, we find the 100th term by substituting 100 where there is 𝑛 on our equation. This yields � �100 = 4(100) +1 = 401 e) Since we now have the general term, to find the nth term that is equal to 1181, we solve for 𝑛 wwhere 𝑇𝑛 = 1181 thus we get � �𝑛 = 4𝑛+1 1181 = 4𝑛+1 1181 −1 =4𝑛 4𝑛 =1180 � � =1180 4 EXAMPLE 2 =295 The first three terms of an arithmetic sequence are 2𝑥 +1 ,𝑥−3 ,3𝑥−4 a) Determine the value of 𝑥 and then write the values of the first three terms.

An arithmetic series is the sum of the arithmetic sequence terms. The formula for the sum of 𝑛 consecutive terms is given by\n� �𝑛 = 𝑛 2 [2𝑎 +(𝑛−1)𝑑] (1.2.1) Or by the following equation if the last term, denoted by 𝐿 is known � �𝑛 = 𝑛 2 (𝑎 +𝐿)\nwhere 𝐿 = 𝑎 +(𝑛−1)𝑑. (1.2.2) Before we proof that the sum of the arithmetic terms are given by (1.2.1/2), let me tell you a story : It is said that back in the 19th century, a teacher was lazy and his learners kept making noise, so he gave them the task to sum num the natural numbers 1 to 100. He knew this would keep them busy and would take them a long time. By surprise, one learner had completed within five minutes or less giving the correct answer of 5050, the teacher was perplexed and asked for the script of the young boy to see what he had done. The young man had used a trick. Suppose 𝑆100 denotes the sum of these numbers � �100 = 1+2+3+⋯98+99+100 2Notations such as ∑𝑎𝑘 were introduced by Leonard Euler who was a prominent polymath and whose work is estimated to be 800 pages of yearly manuscripts 8 | Page Sequence and Series\nReversing this would give the same answer � �100 = 100+99+98+⋯+3+2+1 Then summing the two you’d get twice the amount Suppose 𝑆100 denotes the sum of these numbers 2𝑆100 = (1+100)+(2+99)+(3+98)+⋯+(98+3)+(99+2)+(100+1) 2𝑆100 = 101 +101+101+⋯+101+101+101 2𝑆100 = 100(101) � �100 = 100(101) 2 =10100 =5050. 2 Now we’re going to use this fact to prove the equation that gives the sum of arithmetic terms\nPROOF Suppose you have an arithmetic sequence � �, 𝑎 +𝑑,𝑎+2𝑑,…,𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑\nand let the sum of these terms be denoted by\n� �𝑛 = 𝑎+𝑎+𝑑+𝑎+2𝑑+⋯𝑎+(𝑛−3)𝑑+𝑎+(𝑛−2)𝑑+𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑 � �𝑛 = 𝑎+𝑎+𝑑+𝑎+2𝑑+⋯+𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑 now reversing these terms we get Now adding the two you get � �𝑛 = 𝑛 2 𝑆𝑛 = 𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑+⋯+𝑎+2𝑑+𝑎+𝑑+𝑎 � �𝑛 +𝑆𝑛 = (𝑎+𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑)+⋯+(2𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑)+[2𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑]) 2𝑆𝑛 = 𝑛[2𝑎 +(𝑛−1)𝑑] [2𝑎 +(𝑛−1)𝑑] and where 𝑙 = 𝑎 +(𝑛−1)𝑑 is the last term in the sequence/series � �𝑛 = 𝑛 2 [2𝑎 +(𝑛−1)𝑑] = 𝑛 2 [𝑎 +𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑] =𝑛 2 EXAMPLE 1 Determine the sum of the arithmetic series 4 + 11 + 18 + 25 +⋯+368 SOLUTION What we know is that 𝑙 = 368 and the common difference\n� � =𝑇𝑛+1 −𝑇𝑛 = 7, thus using our equation, we obtain 368 = (7)𝑛+(4)−(7) 7𝑛 =368+3=371 [𝑎 +𝑙] 9 | Page ScienceVisu\n� � =371 =53 7 Then solving for 𝑆𝑛 we get � �53 = 53 2 [4 +368] � �53 = 9858 EXAMPLE 2 How many terms of the arithmetic series 8 + 13 + 18 +⋯ will add up to 1700 SOLUTION What we know is that 𝑆𝑛 = 1700 and the common difference\n� � =𝑇𝑛+1 −𝑇𝑛 = 5, thus using our equation, we obtain 1700 = 𝑛 2 [2(8) + (𝑛 −1)(5)] 1700 ×2 =𝑛[16+5𝑛−5] 3400 = 𝑛[5𝑛+11] = 5𝑛2+11𝑛 5𝑛2 +11𝑛−3400 =0 � � =(−𝑏±√𝑏2−4𝑎𝑐 ) 2𝑎 𝑛 =−11±√112−4(5)(−3400) 2(5) 𝑛 =−136 5 or 𝑛 = 25 Thus 𝑛 = 25 since 𝑆:ℕ → ℝ in simple. EXAMPLE 3 Given the arithmetic series −4 − 1 + 2 + ⋯ a) Calculate the smallest number of terms where 𝑆𝑛 &gt; 300 b) Determine the greatest number of terms that can be added together if the answer must be less than 100 SOLUTION a) Using our formula, we get � � 2 [2(−4) +(𝑛 −1)(3)] &gt; 300 10 | Page Sequence and Series\n� �[−8 +3𝑛−3] &gt; 600 3𝑛2 −11𝑛−600 &gt; 0 � � =11±√112−4(3)(−600) 2(3) 𝑛 &gt;−12.43 or 𝑛 &gt; 16.09 Thus 𝑛 = ⌈16.09⌉ = 17 b) Almost similarly, we have � � 2 [2(−4) +(𝑛 −1)(3)] &lt; 100 3𝑛2 −11𝑛−200 &lt; 0 =11±√112 −4(3)(−200) 2(3) 𝑛 &lt;−6.53 or 𝑛 &lt; 10.20 Thus 𝑛 = ⌊10.20⌋ = 10 EXAMPLE 4 Determine the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 1000 that are not divisible by 5 SOLUTION The sequence of natural numbers is 1,2,3,4,…,1000 up to a 1000 and the sequence of numbers that ARE divisible by 5 is 5,10,15,20,…,1000. So to know the sum of ℕ that are NOT divisible we have to subtract those that are divisible from the sum of the first sequence. Thus � �1000 = 1000 2 𝑆1000 = 500500 [1 +1000] Is the sum of the first sequence.

    "text": "4.3 ARITHMETIC SERIES\nFrom the previous chapter, we showed that a sequence is defined as � �1, 𝑇2, 𝑇3,…,𝑇𝑛\nThus the series is\n� �1 = 𝑇1 2 𝑆2 = 𝑇1 +𝑇2 =∑𝑇𝑖 𝑖=1 3 𝑆3 = 𝑇1 +𝑇2 +𝑇3 = ∑𝑇𝑖 𝑖=1 …\n� � 𝑆𝑛 = 𝑇1 +𝑇2+⋯+𝑇𝑛 =∑𝑇𝑖 𝑖=1 Where 𝑆𝑛 is the sum of all the 𝑛 terms2. An arithmetic series is the sum of the arithmetic sequence terms. The formula for the sum of 𝑛 consecutive terms is given by\n� �𝑛 = 𝑛 2 [2𝑎 +(𝑛−1)𝑑] (1.2.1) Or by the following equation if the last term, denoted by 𝐿 is known � �𝑛 = 𝑛 2 (𝑎 +𝐿)\nwhere 𝐿 = 𝑎 +(𝑛−1)𝑑. (1.2.2) Before we proof that the sum of the arithmetic terms are given by (1.2.1/2), let me tell you a story : It is said that back in the 19th century, a teacher was lazy and his learners kept making noise, so he gave them the task to sum num the natural numbers 1 to 100. He knew this would keep them busy and would take them a long time. By surprise, one learner had completed within five minutes or less giving the correct answer of 5050, the teacher was perplexed and asked for the script of the young boy to see what he had done. The young man had used a trick. Suppose 𝑆100 denotes the sum of these numbers � �100 = 1+2+3+⋯98+99+100 2Notations such as ∑𝑎𝑘 were introduced by Leonard Euler who was a prominent polymath and whose work is estimated to be 800 pages of yearly manuscripts 8 | Page Sequence and Series\nReversing this would give the same answer � �100 = 100+99+98+⋯+3+2+1 Then summing the two you’d get twice the amount Suppose 𝑆100 denotes the sum of these numbers 2𝑆100 = (1+100)+(2+99)+(3+98)+⋯+(98+3)+(99+2)+(100+1) 2𝑆100 = 101 +101+101+⋯+101+101+101 2𝑆100 = 100(101) � �100 = 100(101) 2 =10100 =5050. 2 Now we’re going to use this fact to prove the equation that gives the sum of arithmetic terms\nPROOF Suppose you have an arithmetic sequence � �, 𝑎 +𝑑,𝑎+2𝑑,…,𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑\nand let the sum of these terms be denoted by\n� �𝑛 = 𝑎+𝑎+𝑑+𝑎+2𝑑+⋯𝑎+(𝑛−3)𝑑+𝑎+(𝑛−2)𝑑+𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑 � �𝑛 = 𝑎+𝑎+𝑑+𝑎+2𝑑+⋯+𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑 now reversing these terms we get Now adding the two you get � �𝑛 = 𝑛 2 𝑆𝑛 = 𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑+⋯+𝑎+2𝑑+𝑎+𝑑+𝑎 � �𝑛 +𝑆𝑛 = (𝑎+𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑)+⋯+(2𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑)+[2𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑]) 2𝑆𝑛 = 𝑛[2𝑎 +(𝑛−1)𝑑] [2𝑎 +(𝑛−1)𝑑] and where 𝑙 = 𝑎 +(𝑛−1)𝑑 is the last term in the sequence/series � �𝑛 = 𝑛 2 [2𝑎 +(𝑛−1)𝑑] = 𝑛 2 [𝑎 +𝑎+(𝑛−1)𝑑] =𝑛 2 EXAMPLE 1 Determine the sum of the arithmetic series 4 + 11 + 18 + 25 +⋯+368 SOLUTION What we know is that 𝑙 = 368 and the common difference\n� � =𝑇𝑛+1 −𝑇𝑛 = 7, thus using our equation, we obtain 368 = (7)𝑛+(4)−(7) 7𝑛 =368+3=371 [𝑎 +𝑙] 9 | Page ScienceVisu\n� � =371 =53 7 Then solving for 𝑆𝑛 we get � �53 = 53 2 [4 +368] � �53 = 9858 EXAMPLE 2 How many terms of the arithmetic series 8 + 13 + 18 +⋯ will add up to 1700 SOLUTION What we know is that 𝑆𝑛 = 1700 and the common difference\n� � =𝑇𝑛+1 −𝑇𝑛 = 5, thus using our equation, we obtain 1700 = 𝑛 2 [2(8) + (𝑛 −1)(5)] 1700 ×2 =𝑛[16+5𝑛−5] 3400 = 𝑛[5𝑛+11] = 5𝑛2+11𝑛 5𝑛2 +11𝑛−3400 =0 � � =(−𝑏±√𝑏2−4𝑎𝑐 ) 2𝑎 𝑛 =−11±√112−4(5)(−3400) 2(5) 𝑛 =−136 5 or 𝑛 = 25 Thus 𝑛 = 25 since 𝑆:ℕ → ℝ in simple. EXAMPLE 3 Given the arithmetic series −4 − 1 + 2 + ⋯ a) Calculate the smallest number of terms where 𝑆𝑛 &gt; 300 b) Determine the greatest number of terms that can be added together if the answer must be less than 100 SOLUTION a) Using our formula, we get � � 2 [2(−4) +(𝑛 −1)(3)] &gt; 300 10 | Page Sequence and Series\n� �[−8 +3𝑛−3] &gt; 600 3𝑛2 −11𝑛−600 &gt; 0 � � =11±√112−4(3)(−600) 2(3) 𝑛 &gt;−12.43 or 𝑛 &gt; 16.09 Thus 𝑛 = ⌈16.09⌉ = 17 b) Almost similarly, we have � � 2 [2(−4) +(𝑛 −1)(3)] &lt; 100 3𝑛2 −11𝑛−200 &lt; 0 =11±√112 −4(3)(−200) 2(3) 𝑛 &lt;−6.53 or 𝑛 &lt; 10.20 Thus 𝑛 = ⌊10.20⌋ = 10 EXAMPLE 4 Determine the sum of natural numbers from 1 to 1000 that are not divisible by 5 SOLUTION The sequence of natural numbers is 1,2,3,4,…,1000 up to a 1000 and the sequence of numbers that ARE divisible by 5 is 5,10,15,20,…,1000. So to know the sum of ℕ that are NOT divisible we have to subtract those that are divisible from the sum of the first sequence. Thus � �1000 = 1000 2 𝑆1000 = 500500 [1 +1000] Is the sum of the first sequence. Now we have 1000 = 5𝑛+(5−5) � � =1000 5 Thus\n=200 � �200 = 200 [5 +1000] 2 𝑆200 = 100500 Which is the sum of the series of terms divisible by 5. Now the sum of those that are not divisible by 5 is 11 | Page ScienceVisu\n12 | Page � �1000−𝑆200=500 500−100 500=400 000",
